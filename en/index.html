      <google-codelab-step label="Specify How to Generate Test Code" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>When it comes to testing, specific instructions can be a great way to make sure you&#39;re covering all the necessary scenarios. Instead of giving vague instructions like &#34;add unit tests,&#34; you can provide concrete details about the testing frameworks and the number of cases you want to generate. This can be helpful in utilizing tools like GitHub Copilot, where specifying &#34;use Junit and Mockito to add unit tests, testing at least 10 variations of valid and invalid input combinations&#34; can yield a more accurate and comprehensive result.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>If you are aiming to generate a test code using Junit and Mockito, you can provide the following prompt to GitHub Copilot:</p>
<pre><code language="language-java" class="language-java">// Using Junit and Mockito, add unit tests
// Test at least 10 variations of valid and invalid input combinations
@Test
public void validateInput() {
  // Your code here
}

<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Write a unit test using JUnit that tests a simple method with 3 different valid inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Extend the unit test to include 3 different invalid inputs, and verify that exceptions are handled correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Checklist for Further Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>How can you ensure that the tests cover all the critical paths in the code?</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Writing Test Cases in Natural Language First" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>When working with AI-powered code generation, like GitHub Copilot, expecting comprehensive test coverage without providing clear context to the AI is challenging. Instead of trying to write the test cases in code at that point, create natural language descriptions first. This will focus on improving the test coverage, ensuring that the generated code meets all the necessary criteria.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of how you can write test cases in natural language for a multiplication function. This practice ensures that you cover various scenarios and edge cases before generating the code.</p>
<pre><code language="language-py" class="language-py">class TestMultiply(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_multiply(self): 
    # Tests for different cases, such as positive, negative, zero, decimal, and non-integer inputs
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Write natural language test cases for a function that calculates the area of a triangle. Consider different input scenarios and edge cases.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Use GitHub Copilot to generate code from the natural language test cases you wrote in Exercise 1. Analyze the results.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 3</strong>: Create a test suite using natural language for a more complex function, like a sorting algorithm. Consider various input scenarios and edge cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Checklist for Further Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>What are the benefits of writing test cases in natural language before coding?</li>
<li>How can natural language test cases improve collaboration between developers and non-technical stakeholders?</li>
<li>What are the potential challenges of using this approach, and how might they be mitigated?</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Code to Comment: Generating Comments from Code" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot can generate comments from code. When existing code lacks sufficient comments, or to assist other developers in understanding the code, GitHub Copilot can automatically generate explanations in comment form. The following sample demonstrates the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to list prime numbers less than a given number. While this code does not contain comments, GitHub Copilot can create comments to describe the code&#39;s functionality.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s the code without comments:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">def eratosthenes_sieve(n):
    primes = []
    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)
    for p in range(2, n + 1):
        if sieve[p]:
            primes.append(p)
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                sieve[i] = False
    return primes
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#39;s how GitHub Copilot can add comments to explain it:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python"># Write the description of the method here &lt;- [Actual Prompt]
# Input: n - the number of primes to return
# Output: a list of the first n primes
# Example: eratosthenes_sieve(5) -&gt; [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>Working with structured data is an everyday task for developers. Transforming data from formats like JSON into objects within your programming language allows for more robust and maintainable code. Imagine you have a list of users, and you want to convert this data into user objects within your application. GitHub Copilot can help you in this transformation process, turning a tedious task into a seamless exercise.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s a Python example of how you might convert the given JSON data into a list of user objects:</p>

Rather than dealing with complex Excel, PowerPoint files, PDFs, or image formats, AI will be able to assist your coding efforts collaboratively through text-based documents.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s check if the following files are text-based or AI friendly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure definitions</li>
<li>Database table definitions</li>
<li>Test specifications</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure Definitions</li>
<li>Database Table Definitions</li>
<li>Test Specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you have a table written in markdown like below, GitHub Copilot can use it as a base for migration files and interface files.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot, which utilizes OpenAI&#39;s Large Language Models (LLM) to generate code, has a limitation on the number of tokens it can process. As of 2023, it doesn&#39;t see all of the code that&#39;s open in the editor and doesn&#39;t receive every token. This means that users must carefully limit the context provided to GitHub Copilot. Notably, Copilot doesn&#39;t have access to external repositories or source code placed in GitHub Enterprise Cloud.</p>
<p>The files that GitHub Copilot uses for suggestions are primarily the currently open file and other tab files adjacent to it (basically with the same file extension). To make accurate suggestions, it&#39;s essential to have only the relevant files open. The following is a checklist as of August 2023. The types of files that GitHub Copilot includes as snippets may change in the future, but practices such as &#34;closing unnecessary files&#34; will likely have a positive impact on your coding even if you were not using GitHub Copilot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the files you need to refer to</li>
<li>Close unnecessary files</li>
<li>If there is an .md file you want to refer to, copy it and comment it out</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Consider a scenario where you have a Python function written in one tab and a similar function in an adjacent tab; GitHub Copilot can recognize patterns and suggest improvements.</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python"># tab 1 (adjacent)
def add_numbers(a, b):.
    return a + b
</code></pre>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python"># tab 2
def subtract_numbers(a, b): return a - b
    return a - b

answer = substruct_numbers(1, 2) + add_numbers( # &lt;GitHub Copilot will suggest the code by reading the tab 1 &gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Experiment with reducing the code context sent to Copilot in a complex project. Observe how this affects the suggestions provided.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Discuss with your team the best practice for commenting based on language efficiency and understanding within the team.</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Client-tips: Pin the files you need" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>The effectiveness of GitHub Copilot depends on the context provided to it. GitHub Copilot searches through open tabs by text similarity, sending snippets to the Large Language Model (LLM), which itself is a complete black box. Therefore, we must be mindful of the context we want to provide. In programming, files such as declaration files (d.ts), test files, and interface files contain a wealth of context information. By using Visual Studio Code&#39;s pinning feature, you can easily access these files when needed and provide information to GitHub Copilot more efficiently.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s how you can pin a file in Visual Studio Code:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the file you want to pin.</li>
<li>Right-click on the file tab.</li>
<li>Select &#34;Pin Tab&#34; from the context menu.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Exerecise</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Pin a declaration file (such as a <code>.d.ts</code> file) in your current project and notice how it&#39;s easier to access when working with GitHub Copilot.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Create a new interface file and pin it. Explore how GitHub Copilot can utilize this file for better code suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise 3</strong>: Pin multiple test files within your project and observe how this helps you when writing new test cases with the assistance of Copilot.</li>
</ul>

<p>When working with a complex codebase, jumping between files or searching through layers of code to find the definition of a particular symbol can be cumbersome. &#34;Go to Definition&#34; is a useful feature in Visual Studio Codethat allows developers to quickly navigate to the definition of a symbol in the current file. This not only enhances productivity but also enables better understanding of the code structure. GitHub Copilot will read open tabs. So, you can also pass relevant code snippets related to the symbol definition to GitHub Copilot</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>To use the &#34;Go to Definition&#34; feature in VS Code, simply right-click on the symbol you want to explore and select &#34;Go to Definition.&#34; You can also use the shortcut <code>F12</code>. Here&#39;s how you can do it:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Topic: High-level Architecture First" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>When developing a complex system, it is common to dive into the details of the code and lose sight of the overall architecture of the program. When this happens repeatedly, GitHub Copilot also loses sight of its overall architecture. This can lead to misunderstandings and errors. By designing the high-level architecture of the program first and commenting on the function and purpose of each piece of code during development, GitHub Copilot can better understand the context and make more precise suggestions.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Samples</h3>
<p>Consider an API endpoint file in a web application. Suggesting the design in natural language early on will help GitHub Copilot understand the functionality of each endpoint.</p>
<pre><code language="language-rb" class="language-rb"># GET /items
# - Retrieves a list of items.
# - Returns a collection of items in the response.
# 
# POST /items
# - Creates a new item and adds it to the collection.
# - Expects item parameters in the request.
# - Redirects to the cart page with a success message upon success.
# - Displays the form for a new item if failed.
# 
# GET /items/:id
# - Retrieves an item with a specific ID.
# - Expects the item&#39;s ID as a URL parameter.
# - Returns the requested item&#39;s details in the response.

      <google-codelab-step label="Topic: Working on Small Chunks" duration="0">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Description</h2>
<p>Working on small chunks of code with less context can lead to improved Copilot&#39;s output. Imagine you&#39;re building a complex application with several interconnected components. Instead of trying to generate everything in one go, you break down the task into smaller parts, providing a confined context for Copilot. This approach not only streamlines the development process but also enhances the quality of the generated code.</p>
<p>Some ideas consider context-less architecture in the design phase, but it is difficult to apply a loosely coupled architecture to every project.</p>
<p>Also, changing the architectural design to improve the accuracy of AI tools is not the way to go. This pattern aims to improve GitHub Copilot&#39;s proposal by at least working in small chunks so that the context is as small as possible in the working environment, so that GitHub Copilot does not become overwhelmed by the complexity of the overall project. more controlled, accurate, and efficient code generation that allows you to understand the specific tasks of the clues.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. Instead of asking Copilot for the entire solution, you may start by writing the function signature and then ask for the body:</p>
<pre><code language="language-python" class="language-python">def factorial(n):
  # Ask Copilot to complete this function
